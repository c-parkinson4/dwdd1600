        <p>ADHD, or Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, is a neurodevelopmental condition that affects focus,
            self-control, and energy regulation. Though the name is fairly recent, similar behaviors were described over
            a century ago, and today ADHD is recognized as a common condition that can begin in childhood and continue
            into adulthood, influencing school, work, and daily life.</p>

        <h2>The 3 Types of ADHD Explained</h2>
        <p>ADHD isn’t the same for everyone — in fact, it’s grouped into three main types. The Inattentive Type is
            marked by challenges with focus and organization, the Hyperactive-Impulsive Type involves high energy and
            impulsive behavior, and the Combined Type includes features of both. Knowing the differences helps people
            understand how ADHD can show up in unique ways.</p>

        <h3>Predominately Hyperactive-Implusive Presentation</h3>
        <p>The Hyperactive-Impulsive Type of ADHD is defined by high energy, restlessness, and acting quickly without
            thinking things through. People with this type may fidget, talk a lot, interrupt others, or have trouble
            sitting still, especially in situations that require patience. Because the behaviors are more visible and
            disruptive, this type is often noticed earlier in children, but it can affect people of all ages.</p>
        <h3>Predominately Inattentive Presentation</h3>
        <p>The Inattentive Type of ADHD is often harder to spot because it doesn’t usually involve hyperactive behavior.
            Instead, it’s marked by challenges like losing focus, being easily distracted, forgetting details, and
            struggling with organization. People with this type may seem quiet or daydreamy, which can sometimes cause
            their difficulties to be overlooked, especially in school or work settings.Because they’re usually not
            disruptive, this type can sometimes go unnoticed, especially in girls or adults.</p>

        <h3>Combined Presentation</h3>
        <p>The Combined Type of ADHD is the most common presentation and includes symptoms of both inattention and
            hyperactivity-impulsivity. People with this type may find it hard to stay organized, remember details, or
            focus on tasks, while also feeling restless, energetic, or prone to acting without thinking. Because it
            involves challenges in both areas, the combined type can have a big impact on daily life, but understanding
            it makes it easier to find the right strategies and support.</p>
