        <h1>Symptom Presentation</h1>
        <p>ADHD in girls and women can present differently than in boys or men, which is why it’s often underdiagnosed
            or misdiagnosed. While they may experience the same core symptoms (inattention, hyperactivity, impulsivity),
            the way these symptoms appear can be more subtle or internalized.</p>

        <h2>Common Stereotypes of ADHD Symptoms</h2>
    
        <h3>Inattention</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Easily distracted by noises or surroundings</li>
            <li>Forgetting things (e.g., keys, homework, appointments)</li>
            <li>Losing items constantly (wallet, phone, school supplies)</li>
            <li>Trouble following instructions</li>
            <li>Making “careless mistakes” in schoolwork or tasks</li>
            <li>Zoning out during conversations</li>
            <li>Difficulty organizing tasks or managing time</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Hyperactivity</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Fidgeting or tapping hands/feet</li>
            <li>Restless, can’t stay seated for long</li>
            <li>Talking excessively</li>
            <li>Climbing/running around when it’s inappropriate (more common in kids)</li>
            <li>Always “on the go” or seeming like they have endless energy</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Impulsivity</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Interrupting others frequently</li>
            <li>Blurting out answers before a question is finished</li>
            <li>Difficulty waiting their turn</li>
            <li>Making quick decisions without thinking of consequences</li>
        </ul>





        <h2>Lesser-Known Symptoms</h2>
        <p>
            ADHD is often stereotyped as constant fidgeting, restlessness, or blurting things out, but this narrow view
            overlooks many subtler symptoms. These stereotypes can cause quieter signs to be missed, especially in
            adults and women.
        </p>
        <p>The following is a list of lesser-known ADHD symptoms.</p>

        <dl>
            <dt> Sensitivity (Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria)</dt>
            <dd>Women with ADHD may experience intense emotional pain when they perceive criticism or disapproval, even
                if it's minor or unintentional. They often overreact to small setbacks or social slights and may avoid
                situations where there's a risk of failure or rejection altogether.</dd>

            <dt>Time Blindness</dt>
            <dd>Many women with ADHD frequently lose track of time, underestimating how long tasks will take. Despite
                their best efforts, they may find themselves running late often and struggling to manage schedules or
                deadlines.</dd>

            <dt>Sensory Sensitivities</dt>
            <dd>Sensory overload is common, with women feeling easily overwhelmed by bright lights, loud sounds, certain
                textures, or crowded environments. They may also be especially irritated by things like clothing tags,
                tight waistbands, or background noise.</dd>

            <dt> Transitioning Between Tasks</dt>
            <dd>Switching from one task to another can feel mentally jarring or even paralyzing. Women with ADHD may
                struggle to shift focus smoothly, often feeling "stuck" or unable to reorient themselves when routines
                or tasks change.</dd>

            <dt>Emotional Flooding or Overwhelm</dt>
            <dd>Seemingly manageable tasks or decisions can become emotionally overwhelming. This may lead to emotional
                outbursts, tears, or shutting down entirely during stressful situations, followed by a need for extended
                time to recover emotionally.</dd>

            <dt>Paralysis in the Face of “Simple” Tasks</dt>
            <dd>Tasks that seem simple to others—like replying to emails or making appointments—can feel so overwhelming
                that they’re avoided entirely. This kind of task paralysis is often misunderstood as laziness, when in
                fact it's caused by executive dysfunction.</dd>

            <dt>Chronic Guilt and Shame</dt>
            <dd>Women with ADHD frequently feel guilty for not doing enough, even when they’re doing their best. They
                may carry deep shame about being disorganized, forgetful, or not meeting societal expectations of
                productivity and order.</dd>

            <dt>Hyperfocus on Certain Tasks</dt>
            <dd>While attention can be scattered, women with ADHD can also experience hyperfocus—becoming deeply
                absorbed in hobbies, creative work, or research. They may lose hours in a single task, forgetting to
                eat, sleep, or attend to other responsibilities, which often gives the false impression of being highly
                productive.</dd>

            <dt>Difficulty Regulating Energy</dt>
            <dd>Energy levels may swing between extremes—periods of high energy and productivity followed by total
                exhaustion. It can feel like there’s no in-between state, making daily functioning unpredictable.</dd>

            <dt>Perfectionism and Overcompensation</dt>
            <dd>To compensate for feeling out of control internally, many women with ADHD become perfectionists. They
                may set impossibly high standards for themselves, double- and triple-check their work, and avoid
                delegating tasks out of fear of failure or judgment.</dd>

            <dt>Struggles with Self-Identity</dt>
            <dd>Frequent shifts in interests, personal style, and career paths are common, and many women with ADHD feel
                unsure of who they truly are. They may unconsciously adapt their personality or preferences to fit in
                with the people around them, leading to a fragmented sense of identity.</dd>
